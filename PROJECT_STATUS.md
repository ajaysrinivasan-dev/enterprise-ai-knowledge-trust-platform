# Project status

## Phase 1 — Project foundation

**Status: complete**

Implemented:

- Modular Python package and frontend/data/docs/scripts directories.
- Pydantic settings with `.env` support and upload/model configuration placeholders.
- Structured logging configuration that does not log document contents.
- FastAPI application factory with restricted development CORS.
- Versioned `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/ready` endpoints.
- Streamlit dashboard shell with explicit not-yet-implemented feature messaging.
- `pytest`, Ruff, packaging metadata, `.gitignore`, README, and architecture notes.
- API tests covering safe health/readiness responses.

Verification:

- `py -m pytest`: 6 passed.
- `py -m ruff check .`: passed.

## Phase 2 — Document ingestion and privacy

**Status: core complete**

Implemented:

- Safe basename and path-traversal rejection, extension allowlist, size limits, and
  empty-content checks.
- UTF-8 text, Markdown, PDF, and DOCX parser adapters. PDF/DOCX adapters fail
  explicitly with an actionable dependency error when optional packages are absent.
- Typed parsed-document and PII result models.
- Deterministic email, phone, SSN, labeled-name, and labeled-address detection with
  offsets and confidence values.
- Stable document-scoped redaction placeholders and aggregate counts that exclude raw
  values from metadata.
- Tests for traversal, size limits, empty documents, text normalization, detection, and
  redaction.

Verification:

- `py -m pytest`: 6 passed.
- `py -m ruff check .`: passed.

Limitations:

- The HTTP upload endpoint, persistent document metadata, Presidio adapter, and indexing
  integration are deferred to later phases.
- Pattern detection is probabilistic and does not guarantee that all PII is found.

## Phase 3 — Retrieval foundation

**Status: foundation complete**

Implemented:

- Metadata-preserving word-window chunking with validated overlap and stable chunk IDs.
- Dependency-free in-memory lexical retriever for local fallback and deterministic tests.
- Retrieval result objects that always retain the originating document and source name.

Verification:

- `py -m pytest`: 9 passed.
- `py -m ruff check .`: passed after formatting the new test imports.

Limitations:

- Sentence-transformer embeddings, ChromaDB persistence, optional reranking, grounded
  generation, and citation validation are still outstanding.

## Next phase

Phase 3 will add chunking, embeddings, vector storage, retrieval, grounded generation,
and citation integrity while keeping model services optional in deterministic tests.

## Known limitations

- Authentication, persistence, document ingestion, retrieval, generation, verification,
  agent tools, evaluation, and fine-tuning are not implemented yet.
- Readiness currently checks only process-level readiness; dependency checks will be
  added when those dependencies exist.
